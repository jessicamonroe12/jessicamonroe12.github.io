    <h1>I have no clue what I'm doing</h1>
    <div>
    According to w3schools this is a text element inside of a div element.
    <p>This text is supposed to have a different background color but I'm not sure if I'm doing this correctly so we'll see</p>
    If I did this right then we'll still be inside of the div element (I hope this looks cool)
