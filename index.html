    <h1>Quotes From "The Office"</h1>
    <p>"And I knew exactly what to do, but in a much more real sense, I had no idea what to do" - Michael Scott
    "It's like I used to tell ym wife. I do not apologize unless I think I'm wrong, and if you don't like it, you can leave. And I say the same thing to my current wife, and I'll say it to my next one, too" - Stanley Hudson
    "I talk a lot, so I've learned to just tune myself out..." - Kelly Kapoor
    "I am Beyonce always." - Michael Scott
